\section{Technical Appendix}
For a better understanding, we provide auxiliary resources regarding our proposed EIISRS model in the appendix, including algorithm, complexity analysis, and additional case studies.
\section{A{\quad}Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}[h]
    \caption{The first training epoch of EIISRS}
    \label{alg:algorithm}
    \textbf{Input}: user-item interaction matrix $\textbf{\textit{R}}$, social networks $\textbf{\textit{S}}$, and Gaussian random initialize user embeddings $\textbf{\textit{P}}^{(0)}$ and item embeddings $\textbf{\textit{Q}}^{(0)}$\\
    \textbf{Output}: user embeddings $\textbf{\textit{P}}_{final}$ and item embeddings $\textbf{\textit{Q}}$, augmented social networks $\widetilde{\textbf{\textit{S}}}$
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \For{each iteration}
            \For{each batch}
                \State $\textbf{\textit{P}}^{(0)}_s, \textbf{\textit{P}}^{(0)}_r \gets$ Eq.(1); \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\Comment{Self-gating Unit}}
                \For{$l=1:L$}
                    \State $\textbf{\textit{P}}^{(l)}_s$, $\textbf{\textit{P}}^{(l)}_r$, $\textbf{\textit{Q}}^{(l)}$ $\gets$ Eq.(2)-(4);\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\Comment{Graph Conv.}}
                    \State $\boldsymbol{\mu}^{(l)}$, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} \gets$ Eq.(8);
                    \State $\textbf{\textit{z}}^{(l)} \gets$ Eq.(9); \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\Comment{Social Diversity Simulation}}
                    \State $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \gets$ Eq.(5);
                    \State Calculate the $\mathcal{L}_{reconstruct}$ and $KLD$;
                \EndFor
                \State $\textbf{\textit{P}}_s = \sum_{i=0}^{L}\textbf{\textit{P}}_s^{(l)}$; \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\Comment{Social Influence Propagation}}
                \State $\textbf{\textit{P}}_{final} \gets$ Eq.(14);
                \State Calculate the pairwise BPR loss $\mathcal{L}_{rec}$;
            \EndFor
            \State $\widetilde{\textbf{\textit{S}}} \gets$ Eq.(10)-(13); \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\Comment{Social Influence Exploration}}
        \EndFor
        \State return $\textbf{\textit{P}}_{final}, \textbf{\textit{Q}}, \widetilde{\textbf{\textit{S}}}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
For the rest training epochs, we replace the social networks \textbf{\textit{S}} with augmented social networks $\widetilde{\textbf{\textit{S}}}$ as input.

\section{B{\quad}Complexity Analysis}
This section is going to talk about the model size and time complexity of our model.
\subsection{Model Size}
For model size, there are six parts that introduce trainable parameters: user/item embeddings, self-gating units, layerwise attention unit, selectors, encoder/decoder in LGE-VAE, and aggregation matrix. The size of user and item embeddings in total is $(m+n)\times d$. Each self-gating unit and layerwise attention unit occupied $(d+1)\times d$, altogether $3\times (d+1)$. $K$ selectors take up $k\times m$ in total. Encoder occupies $2\times d\times d$ while decoder is $d\times d$, same as the aggregation matrix. To sum up, the total size of our model is approximately equal to $(m+n+7d+3)\times d+ k\times m$. Owing to $d\ll min(m,n)$ and $k\ll m$, our model is fairly portable.
\subsection{Time Complexity}
For time complexity, analogously, there are also the six parts that cost our computational power. Regarding graph convolution, the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(|\textbf{\textit{R}}^+|dL)$ for the user-item bipartite graph, and $\mathcal{O}(|\textbf{\textit{S}}^+|dL)$ for the social graph, where $|\textbf{\textit{R}}^+|$ and $|\textbf{\textit{S}}^+|$ denote the non-zero values of original graph respectively. Compared with previous graph-based recommendation systems, we drop out the feature transformation matrix and activation function, so the time complexity of graph convolution is relatively slower. For the self-gating units, layerwise attention unit, encoder/decoder of LGE-VAE, and aggregation matrix, the time complexity is as low as $\mathcal{O}(md^2)$. The most intractable time consumption is the selectors. Since we need to calculate the cosine similarity among all users, the time complexity used to be $\mathcal{O}(m^2d)$, where it would be exponentially increased along with the linear increment of our input data. To tackle this problem, for each epoch, we only choose a tiny subset of users $\mathcal{U}^+$ to do the processing, in which $|\mathcal{U}^+| \ll m$. After the two most time-consuming components, namely graph convolution and selectors, have been tailored without spoiling the effectiveness, our model is fairly efficient, too.

\section{C{\quad}Case Study}
This section exhibits some case studies of our model as supplements, in order to illustrate the validity of our hypothesis. For simplification, we take LastFM as an example. 
\subsection{Analysis of Implicit Social Graph}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{implicit.pdf} %1.png是图片文件的相对路径
  \caption{Illustration of the similarity with implicit social neighbors.}
  \label{fig_implicit}
\end{figure}
\noindent As shown in Figure \ref{fig_implicit}, the color shows the similarity between sampled neighbors and generated implicit neighbors. The closer the score to 1, the more similar the two users are, and the lighter the color is. Vice versa. We can observe from the graph that different candidate neighbors have different similarities. We can make an inference that the implicit neighbors are not always highly similar to the sampled user since the anchor user probably has diverse interests and cannot be exactly assigned to an agminated neighborhood. It is also evidence of why we apply social diversity simulation in our model.
